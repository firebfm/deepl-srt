# deepl-srt
Use Selenium to automate translation of a Chinese srt to English on Deepl website

## Installation

You need Chrome and download chromedriver and put it in the driver_path which is C:\Program Files (x86)
```python
pip install selenium
```

## Usage example
```python
python deeplv4.py
```

## Note this script is for Windows users
Ctrl C and Ctrl V is the copy paste command for Windows users. That's what I wrote the code to do. For MacOS users you need to change the copy paste command inside the code.
